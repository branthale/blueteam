Blue Teams tools and tactics


This repo is to share ideas, tools, and tactics for cyber blue teams.  

One of the challenges in cyber defense is understanding the attacker and knowing how to detect them.

Specific Technologies that are used in exercises are mentioned with some samples and code to help identify them.

Red Team tools such as Cobalt Strike can provide a safe way to test your skills at detection.  I have included some packet captures and powershell to investigate.
