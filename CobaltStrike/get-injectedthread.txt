    .SYNOPSIS 
    
    Looks for threads that were created as a result of code injection.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    
    Memory resident malware (fileless malware) often uses a form of memory injection to get code execution. Get-InjectedThread looks at each running thread to determine if it is the result of memory injection.
    
    Common memory injection techniques that *can* be caught using this method include:
    - Classic Injection (OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread)
    - Reflective DLL Injection
    - Memory Module
    NOTE: Nothing in security is a silver bullet. An attacker could modify their tactics to avoid detection using this methodology.
